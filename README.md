In this project I have performed web scraping on wikipedia page to fetch table containing data about stadiums accross the world.
After Extracting I have performed transformation to the data. So the final output of this project is cleaned and be used directlly for visuallization.
For this project, I have used python for logic building and Airflow for developing the data pipeline.
